## Load the data in RStudio

Imported refine_original.csv in RStudio and view to check
```{r}
View(titanic_original)
```

Converting data into data frame called "refine"
```{r}
titanic <- read.csv("titanic_original.csv")
```

## Port of embarkation
```{r}
titanic$embarked <- sub("^$", "S", titanic$embarked)
```

## Age
```{r}
summary(titanic$age)
titanic$age[is.na(titanic$age)] <- 29.88
```

Could have used the median number instead, rather than having an age with decimals. 

## Lifeboat
```{r}
titanic$boat <- sub("^$", "NA", titanic$boat)
```

## Cabin
```{r}
titanic$has_cabin_number <- factor(with(titanic$has_cabin_number,ifelse((titanic$cabin==""),0,1)))
```

## Submit the project
```{r}
write.csv(titanic,file="titanic_clean.csv",row.names=FALSE)
```
